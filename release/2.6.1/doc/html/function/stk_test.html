<pre> STK_TEST performs tests for a given M-file.

 FIXME (ticket #86): Convert help text below to plain text

 -*- texinfo -*-
 @deftypefn  {Command} {} test @var{name}
 @deftypefnx {Command} {} test @var{name} quiet|normal|verbose
 @deftypefnx {Function File} {} test ('@var{name}', 'quiet|normal|verbose', @var{fid})
 @deftypefnx {Function File} {} test ([], 'explain', @var{fid})
 @deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{success} =} test (@dots{})
 @deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{n}, @var{max}] =} test (@dots{})
 @deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{code}, @var{idx}] =} test ('@var{name}', 'grabdemo')

 Perform tests from the first file in the loadpath matching @var{name}.
 @code{test} can be called as a command or as a function.  Called with
 a single argument @var{name}, the tests are run interactively and stop
 after the first error is encountered.

 With a second argument the tests which are performed and the amount of
 output is selected.

 @table @asis
 @item 'quiet'
  Don't report all the tests as they happen, just the errors.

 @item 'normal'
 Report all tests as they happen, but don't do tests which require
 user interaction.

 @item 'verbose'
 Do tests which require user interaction.
 @end table

 The argument @var{fid} can be used to allow batch processing.  Errors
 can be written to the already open file defined by @var{fid}, and
 hopefully when Octave crashes this file will tell you what was happening
 when it did.  You can use @code{stdout} if you want to see the results as
 they happen.  You can also give a file name rather than an @var{fid}, in
 which case the contents of the file will be replaced with the log from
 the current test.

 Called with a single output argument @var{success}, @code{test} returns
 true if all of the tests were successful.  Called with two output arguments
 @var{n} and @var{max}, the number of successful tests and the total number
 of tests in the file @var{name} are returned.

 If the second argument is 'explain', then @var{name} is ignored and an
 explanation of the line markers used is written to the file @var{fid}.
